*Create compost based on what you toss into a composter!*

### Get more than just bone meal!
Compost modifies the vanilla composter to allow you to change what compost you get out of it! With version 3.x, the composter now uses a vanilla styled loot table for generating compost, offering the vast configurability that loot tables make possible. Simply create a data pack with a `compost:composter` loot table to use your own configuration!

You can make some items renewable that should be but are not, create deep interactions with different compostables for a complex and realistic compost, or simply make the compost give a modded compost item. The choice is yours!

### Let the world change your compost!
Compost supports using origin-based conditions in your loot table. You can have compost that generates only under certain light levels, elevations, biomes, dimensions, and more! Have a mod that adds an origin-based condition such as one that checks if it is snowing? Compost can use that to determine what compost is created, allowing nature to play a distinct role the composting process.

### Grow compost based on what compostables you add to it!
Compost adds a loot condition for matching what compostables have been used on the composter, so what you put in can determine what you get out! Want a chance of getting apple seeds when you compost apples? How about modded mulch when you compost saplings? Compost gives you the ability to do such and more!

Please note that the default compost loot table is designed to showcase Compost's compostable matching condition to make bone meal available for villager farmers. You may also find mushrooms growing in your compost when the composter is rained upon in game versions that support the necessary conditions.
