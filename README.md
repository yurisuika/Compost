**Compost** is a Fabric/Forge mod for Minecraft that makes composters turn your food waste into whatever you want! Have you ever thought that bone meal wasn't quite the right product that a composter should bring to the game? Well, now you can change the composter to produce dirt, apples, or even diamonds! Bring out the true essence of a composter and get dirty!

Compost now features JSON configurability! The default config has entries for both dirt and bone meal, but you can make it whatever you want! Simply set the item name, the chance, and the min/max range for the number of items to be dropped! You can have as many entries as you desire!

While Compost can be ran only server-side, you may want to run it on your client as well for its <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items">Roughly Enough Items</a> integration!

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch <branch> --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/compost.git

cd ./compost

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
